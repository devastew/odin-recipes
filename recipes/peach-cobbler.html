    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe was inspired by one from Renee Erickson's in cookbook, 'A Boat, a Whale, and a Walrus.' It's a lot crispier than a regular cobbler, and you can use the technique for other fruit cobblers. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large fresh peaches, pitted and cut into eighths</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Batter:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1/3 cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>2/3 cup whole milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Glaze:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold water, or as needed to wet topping sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on the rack under the middle rack to catch drips. Generously butter a 2-inch deep (2-quart) baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place peach sections into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with lemon juice and zest.</li>
        <li>Stir butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl. Mix until creamed and resembles a sugary, buttery paste, 4 to 5 minutes. Add oats and flour; stir until flour and oats are incorporated into the butter-sugar mixture and mixture resembles coarse crumbs, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour in milk; stir until mixture is wet and creamy, like a thick spreadable batter, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drop batter by spoonful on top of the peaches. Spread batter evenly over the surface of the peaches. Sprinkle 1/4 cup sugar on the batter. Spritz with water until sugar is wet and surface glistens.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven on middle rack until browned and crispy, about 45 minutes. Let cool at least 30 minutes before serving.        </li>
    </ol>
